<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



The Fun Hub is a project idea for Simplilearn/IBM SLackathon.

I am working on the project during the completion of my Simplilearn Professional Certificate Program In Data Science with University of Purdue in Collaboration with IBM.

Here is the project idea:
* Imagine a OTT service provider "__The Fun Hub__"
* Subscription to the Fun Hub offers you access to the main OTT plateforms (for example Netflix, Disney +, Amazon Prime)
* The Fun Hub algorithm will suggest programs based on preferences, as well as the agremment it signed with the other OTT plateforms based on a ratio of programs from each plateform.

## project Idea

The prject idea is quite simple. Many OTT plateforms users have to choose between different plateforms, or pay subscriptions to different palteforms.
__The Fun Hub__ is a OTT plateform service has agreements with the main OTT palteforms (say for example Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Dinsey +) and guarantree to these provides a minimum number of customers and views. The plateforms offer then a discount sube scription price (negociated on the number of views) and access to users preferences data.

__The Fun Hub__ is hence able to offer access to the porfolio of all the OTT plateforms at a competitive price, and the user historical views preferences will help suggesting relevant shows.

### Prerequisites

*SLA with OTT plateforms with a number of views per cycle (weekly, monthly).

*Access to OTT plateforms raw data about users shows ratings.

### Workflow

  <h3 align="center">The Fun Hub Workflow</h3>
</div>

Here is a simple workflow on how the recommender system will work.

1. The the module 1 combines the meta data from the various OTT palteforms
2. A combined list of preferences is updated.
3. The module 2 will consider the user visioning views, and preferences, and matches this wit other viewers and build a list of shows.
4. The module 3 will put a constraint on the lsit of priorities based on the number of views for each OTT and reprioritize the list of shows.
5. A feedback from the user is collected to improve the model recommendations.
